# Unibots Meeting 2021-08-29

- Decide whether we are kit based?
- Competition design
- We want a UK competition:
- Already contacted
    - Soton
    - Imperial
    - Cambs
    - Oxf*ord
        - their society's core is 3D printing; they don't do much robotics; but let's contact them again
- Combative or constructive
    - it is more fun to have robots compete against each other
    - also increases the level of difficulty as teams can use more strategy to do better
- *Approximate budget*
- Sources of funding are teams self funded or provided with standard parts
- Autonomous robot vs not
